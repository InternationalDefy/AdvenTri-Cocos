# AdvenTri-Cocos
## What is This? 
- Adventri is a 2D Cocos based adventure game(Unfinished)
- It is mainly developed in 2018, I wrote many codes seperately. This is my fundamental attempt to do everything in Cpp. 
## You may not Earn, But you can Learn.
There are many **"making-the-wheel"** actions like implementation to a light-weighted DBMS, data parsers, my own event dispatchers event an python-implemented GUI editor. For now I would say these things are useless, but I have valuable programming experience in doing these duplicate things.
- When the time goes on, and I know a more vast world with beautiful tools like Unity, Unreal, OpenGL, D3D12, and Rust, I just gave up my idea on cocos and go on to find a better way in game programming.
